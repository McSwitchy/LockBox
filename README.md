# LockBox
A software for creating a remotely controlled LockBox using ESP32, a solenoid lock and other sensors.

Now with Chaster.app integration

![LockBox Picture](./renders/photo.jpeg)

Fot this project I used:
 * Adafruit Huzzah32
 * Adafruit monochrome epaper display feather wing
 * 12v solenoid lock (you may use the 5v version available on Adafuit shop but will need modifications in the code or on the lock)
 * 5v to 12v converter (if using 12v lock)
 * DS3231 RTC module from AliExpress
 * Simple Relay
 * End of travel sensor or something similar or button (I used a button with integrates spring salvaged from an old device)
 * Push button
 * A LED (integrated in the button in my case)

## Build
 * Copy the file lockbox.h.dist to lockbox.h and set your wifi credentials
 * Compile and upload the code using Arduino IDE
 * Upload the web file to the ESP32 using the method described here  
   * ~~(Arduino IDE 1.8 needed): https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/~~
   * using platform.io: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-vs-code-platformio-spiffs/
     1. Click the PIO icon at the left side bar. The project tasks should open.
     2. Select env:esp32doit-devkit-v1 (it may be slightly different depending on the board youâ€™re using).
     3. Expand the Platform menu.
     4. Select Build Filesystem Image.
     5. Finally, click Upload Filesystem Image.
     * Important: to upload the filesystem image successfully you must close all serial
connections (Serial Monitor) with your board.
 * Have fun

## Schema
Here you can find an example of a schema for this. 

The e-paper display is not represented, and the component may not be accurate.

NOTE: Using the 5v to 12v converter requires a 3A power supply, you may want to power it using 12v and have a 12v to 5v converter for the Microcontroller

pretty sure the codebase isn't using the extension api yet (extension endpoints all include `/api/extensions` but don't see this anywhere in src files)
